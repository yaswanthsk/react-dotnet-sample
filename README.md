2. Navigate inside the project folder and open another terminal window in the folder.
3. In one of the terminal windows, enter the backend folder and run `dotnet run` to start the backend part of the application.
4. In the other terminal window, enter the frontend folder. From there, run `npm install` to install all the dependencies needed to run the application.
