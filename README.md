1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/sethbr11/react-dotnet.git` in a terminal window.
2. Navigate inside the project folder and open another terminal window in the folder.
3. In one of the terminal windows, enter the backend folder and run `dotnet run` to start the backend part of the application.
4. In the other terminal window, enter the frontend folder. From there, run `npm install` to install all the dependencies needed to run the application.
5. In the same frontend folder, run `npm run start` to start the frontend part of the application. It should automatically open a browser window to the application displaying a table which pulls data from the .NET backend.
